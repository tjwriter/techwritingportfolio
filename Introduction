#Overview
This repository serves as a portfolio for my technical writing. 

##About me
I am a highly motivated, resourceful, flexible computer science graduate with 4 years of experience in IT and software development. 
For the last 10 years I have been running my own translation business, requiring financial management, excellent communication, leadership, 
project management, networking, writing, formatting, and many other hard and soft skills I hope to utilise now as I move back into the tech sector. 
With my combination of technical education and professional experience in both IT and writing, I believe I am well placed to begin my career as a 
technical writer.
